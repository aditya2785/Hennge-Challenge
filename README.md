FEATURES:

      Fully recursive solution.

      No for, while, try, except, or comprehensions used.

      Complies with Python 3.13+.



INPUT FORMAT:

    N
    X1
    Y1_1 Y1_2 ... Y1_X1
    X2
    Y2_1 Y2_2 ... Y2_X2
    ...
    XN
    YN_1 YN_2 ... YN_XN

N is the number of test cases (1 ≤ N ≤ 100)

Each test case has:

X: number of integers expected in the next line (0 < X ≤ 100)

A line with X integers Y (−100 ≤ Y ≤ 100)



OUTPUT
One line per test case with the sum of the 4th powers of all non-positive integers.

If the number of integers does not match the expected count, output -1.
